## CAN SDK for C

This is the Canis Labs CAN C SDK. It provides a uniform API for CAN that is portable to different CAN controller hardware, and also to different microcontroller targets.

The first CAN controller for this API is the Microchip MCP25xxFD. This is the CAN controller on the Canis Labs CANPico board. A binding for that board is included.

## Building

Application code should include `canapi.h` for the definitions and relevant driver.

Add to the build for the MCP25xxFD CAN controller:
* `mcp25xxfd/mcp25xxfd.c`

Compilation options:
* Define `MCP25xxFD` to bring in the appropriate driver defintions
* Define `HOST_CANPICO` to build for the Canis Labs CANPico

See the reference manual (`docs/2208-02-RM.pdf`) for more details.

## Hello World example for the CANPico

There is a simple 'hello world' example program for the CANPico, built using the Pico C SDK. To build it, install the pre-requisites (Pico C SDK, Arm cross-compiler) and set PICO_SDK_PATH to where the Pico SDK is installed. Then:

    $ cmake CMakeLists.txt
    $ make

Program the firmware in the file `can_hello.uf2` to the Pico in the normal way. For Pico W support, see CMakeLists.txt. 

More on the CANPico can be found at the Canis Labs web site:

There is also a blog post on how to debug in C for the Pico using Microsoft Visual Studio Code as an embedded IDE:

## MicroPython API

This CAN SDK for C is used by the Canis Labs MicroPython firmware build for the CANPico. See the Canis Labs CANHack repository: https://github.com/kentindell/canhack in `pico/micropython`

## Changes in 2023-03-05 update

- Fixes for silicon errata (now uses CRC-protected reads from controller)
- Bug fixes (CAN ID mapping was incorrect for extended ID frames)
- Added support for multiple instances of a CAN controller (including binding to SPI interface)
- Renamed files with 'mcp2517fd' to 'mcp25xxfd' to better reflect devices supported
- Added support for Pico W in example program

## Changes in 2024-11-03 update

- Added support for CAN FD frames; this should be regarded as alpha state (it has been seen to send FD and receive FD frames, though)

## Future

Roadmap includes:

- Support for the on-chip bxCAN of the STM32 family
- Sleep and wakeup support
- Better FIFO design
- Support for the Bullseye (bullseye.com) CCover code coverage tool
- A 'signal' API to extract fields of a CAN frame (within ID or payload) to allow
  fast decoding of a CAN frame
